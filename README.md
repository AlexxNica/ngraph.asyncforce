# ngraph.asyncforce

Force based graph layout with web workers.

Work in progress. I'm trying to make API of this module backward compatible with
`ngraph.forcelayout`. See [demo folder](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.asyncforce/tree/master/demo/)
for examples, but keep in mind that this will is not yet 100% backward compatible.
